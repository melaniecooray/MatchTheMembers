Match the Members:

This app is designed to make it easier to learn the names of all the members of MDB! The welcome screen displays a start button that the user clicks to begin the game. Once on the main screen, a random picture of a MDB member and 4 name options are displayed. The user picks which name they think matches the picture. If correct, the button will turn green and if incorrect, the button will turn red. The main screen also displays a start/stop button and a timer. The user has 5 seconds to answer each picture. If the timer reaches 0, that picture is skipped and the next picture is displayed. There is also a score count displayed on the screen. The user can also click the Done button at the top right of the screen to go to the statistics screen. This screen displays the user's longest streak and the results of their last three turns.
